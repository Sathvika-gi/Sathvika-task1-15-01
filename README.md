# Semantic HTML Personal Profile Page

## Overview
This project is a personal profile web page built using **pure semantic HTML**.  
The goal of the task was to understand how HTML structure works and how semantic
elements improve readability, accessibility, and maintainability.

## What I Did
- Created the HTML boilerplate manually to understand document structure.
- Used **semantic HTML elements** such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`,
  `<article>`, and `<footer>` instead of generic `<div>` tags.
- Organized content into logical sections: About, Education, Skills,
  Projects & Achievements, Certifications, and Contact.
- Added **internal navigation links** to allow smooth jumping between sections.
- Included a **profile image placeholder** with proper `alt` text for accessibility.
- Used appropriate heading levels (`<h1>` to `<h3>`), paragraphs, and lists.
- Added clear **comments in the code** explaining why semantic elements were used.

## Tools Used
- HTML5
- Visual Studio Code

## Outcome
A clean, accessible, and well-structured personal profile page that follows
HTML best practices and demonstrates a clear understanding of semantic markup.
